# Thermodynamic-Phase-Transitions-in-Large-Language-Models-A-Spin-Glass-Perspective-on-Hallucination
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a sudden degradation in factual accuracy known as "hallucination." While often treated as a statistical error, we propose a thermodynamic framework where hallucination corresponds to a disorder-induced phase transition
